Hello! Thank you for your patience! I appreciate you a lot! 



Moneymeta Project Description


Website: moneymeta.app

Site host: Either Google Sites or Webflow


What I need

I need a website with ads on the site

Everything needs to work automatically. If I need to do anything at all on the website or on an external platform being used for the website I need know before you proceed with the project. With the exception of the ads, I’m assuming there’s things I will have to do with those. 

The website must be compatible for desktops, tablets, and phones.

I need video players that shows ads in between videos, and has banner ads on the top, bottom, and sides of the player—on both the inside and the outside of the player if possible.

The video players must hide any YouTube logos if videos are being used from YouTube.

The video players must show the Moneymeta logo on the videos that are playing.

The video players must display a schedule like the ones on the site currently do.

The topics for the video players are:

Money-related news
Classic Car Auctions
Other Auctions
Government Press Conferences

The video players and schedules need to work automatically.

There must be two fallback feeds in place incase something on the schedule doesn’t play, and both the video in the player and the schedule should adjust accordingly.

I will need smaller schedules for the players on the homepage. Each video player will be on the homepage and it will also have it’s own page on the website. 

Each video player should have the moneymeta logo, a play/pause button, and a full screen button. There should not be a share button. 


I need to be the admin on any sites that are used to help create website, netlify, react, etc. 

I need know how to change our logo on the video players

I need to know how to work whatever we are using for the ads



I need any documents that were uploaded into external sites so I can edit them if I need to

I also need a script/widget that takes press releases that are sent to my email and puts them on my site like an article. The original source of the release (what company sent it out) should be on the release, but the release should be on my site, it should not take visitors to a different site. Is it possible to have the widget format them a certain way? Will the widget format them neatly?

12 articles should appear on the home page. On a desktop it should show 4 rows with 3 articles in each row. The articles should show a photo, the title, and than have a time stamp in hours:

For example: 4h
Unless it hasn’t been an hour, then it should be in minutes until it reaches 1 hour. For example: 59m

When over 72 hours passes, the time stamp on the article should change to days. For example: 5d

The timestamp should start when the article is posted on the site

The photo for the article should either be the logo of the company/business that sent it out, a photo that was in the press release, or the moneymeta coin logo
