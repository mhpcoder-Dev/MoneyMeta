	> Hi! Would you be interested in this job? Create two widgets that will list sales at various stores. The widgets should automatically update to show sales that apply to part of the store (30% off at ___ for example), as well as individual items on sale. We have a list of stores and a Google Sheet with links to their sales, a Google Apps Script filled out, and visuals and codes for the design. The widgets are for two different websites, but they should do they same thing. Both websites are Google sites. I also need the widgets to pull sales from my email. Then we also need 2 other widgets that pull press releases from my emails.

- 9:38 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hello,
	> I can build the four widgets (two for sales and two for press releases) for your Google Sites using Google Apps Script, Gmail, and Google Sheets integration.
	>
	> I have experience developing automated systems with Google Apps Script , so I can customize the scripts and visuals you already have for a smooth, real-time display.
	>
	> Let’s discuss your existing script and sheet setup so I can get started right away.

	> Hi Brianne, any update on the project?

- 7:50 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Hi! Are you free to discuss the project in more detail over Google meets/video chat today?
	>
	> Are you free at 1:15pm Eastern Standard Time? If not, when would you be available today? 😃

- 7:59 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Yeah sure

- 8:37 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Okay! What is your email address? 😃

- 8:38 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> According to Upwork policy, we can't share contact details before starting a contract.

- 8:46 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> You removed this message

- 9:04 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> It will be better if you can share the Google sites with me or the website link."mehedi11908015". I have experience with Google app script and web app but don't have worked with Google site.According to my initial study, we can embed the widget in the Google sites and the widget will be created using google web app. As you mentioned, you already have the widget design,then I just have to write the app script logic to update the widget where the sales list will come from Google sheet and the press release from your mail.

- 12:39 AM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hello Brianne,
	> are you available to join the meeting today to discuss about the job requirements . If you are on tight schedule then you can just create a loom video explaining the requirements and it will be enough. If I have any question then I can ask later. Also please share the sites and Appscript project with me and I will review the sheet structure, google sites and the Appscript project you already have. Then we can start working on this project.

- 1:43 AM — Brianne Talocka (Nov 5, 2025 | 1:43 AM)
	> Sure! No problem at all! Does 1:30pm Eastern Standard Time tomorrow work for you?

- 1:50 AM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Can we join now or you can send me a loom video explaining the project requirements

- 1:52 AM — Brianne Talocka
	> Hi! I apologize for not getting back to you until now. We have a different project! Would you be able to create a video player widget for a Google site, that streams videos from certain business TV channels RSS feeds and YouTube channels? And would you also be able to put ads along the sides, top, and bottom of the video player?

- 1:57 AM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> I need to do some research on adding the AdSense widget. Once I’m done, I’ll get back to you with an update on whether it’s feasible or not.

- 6:59 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Hi! Do you know if it’s feasible yet? 😄

- 7:09 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hi Brianne,
	> I haven’t found enough resources yet to make a final decision about adding AdSense directly to Google Sites. Just to confirm, are you referring to custom ads, AdSense ads, or both?
	> In any case, we can create a separate web app to handle all the dynamic functionality and then embed it into the Google Site.
	> If you can share a Google Site where I can test the setup, I’ll start experimenting with the system.

- 8:16 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> I just want ads on the site! I dont care if it's adsense or something else!
	> Can you access this link?

## Saturday, Nov 08

- 12:20 AM — Brianne Talocka
	> 😄 no problem!

- 12:45 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hi Brianne,
	>
	> Thanks for being flexible. I have checked different resources and tried a little bit to implement, and according to my research, we can't embed AdSense-like services directly using the embed by code feature. That's why I was thinking about using Google web app with different ad sections and embedding them in our chosen places. But according to the Terms & Conditions of AdSense-like advertisers, they need to verify the domain owner. As the Google web app URL looks like "script.google.com/" and is owned by Google, and we can't change the web app domain, we can't show ads there. However, if you are looking for custom ad banners, then we can show them and rotate them through the web app using Google Apps Script.
	>
	> So basically, for monetization, we can't use Google Sites according to their policy. But I am suggesting a different approach which will remove the difficulties we are facing. Since your Google Site does not contain that much information and you are using a simple layout, we can build this entire system using React for the frontend and use Google Sheets as the database if needed, using Google Cloud Platform project, where we can use the Google Sheets API, YouTube API, and Google Drive API for free with a free tier limit. According to my observation, we don't need resources beyond the free tier.
	>
	> Then we can host the website on the free version of Netlify, where we will have a custom subdomain of Netlify, and if we want, we can also add our custom domain. Since we will have a custom subdomain for free and can run JavaScript as we want, we can show ads there. It will not cost you much. Within $100, I can migrate your full website from Google Sites to Netlify. Also, if you think you need to move more websites, then we can discuss it and reduce the project price.

- 6:21 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Hi! My domain for this site is Moneymeta.app
	>
	> Does this change anything?
	>
	> Home
	> moneymeta

- 6:38 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Thanks for sharing the domain you are using. However, it won't help because Google Sites does not allow embedding arbitrary JavaScript. Initially, I considered creating an Apps Script Web App and embedding it in Google Sites, but Google does not allow mapping a custom domain or subdomain to an Apps Script Web App and that's why we can't show ads there also. Also note that services like AdSense require few pages whose primary content is the site's original content rather than embedded content, according to my research

- 6:21 PM — Brianne Talocka (Nov 8, 2025 | 6:21 PM)
	> Hi! My domain for this site is Moneymeta.app

	> Hi! Here is part 1 of the project description! I will send you the places to use for sources and codes I made shortly! I got very tied up today! If you accept this project I would test out the ads first, because if they dont work on Google sites we will use Webflow! Make sure you can and are willing to do this project and tell me what your total price is when you go over everything! Thank you so much! 😃

	> Hi! 😃 Here you go! Thank you again for your patience and understanding! If you need me to organize this better let me know! I just dont have the energy to do it tonight. Basically I need two widgets, one that shows current things governments are selling/auctioning, and one that shows future things they might be auctioning. There should be a comment section for each item. The other instructions are in this document! Let me what the cost would be for this! And if you need me to do anything/help in anyway let me know! It will not affect your pay in anyway! I'm also going to send you details on another assignment within the next 30 minutes!

	> Hi! So for the legal attribution, is it possible to create a script/code that puts the correct attribution in automatically, or that puts whatever the attribution rule is onto a data sheet for it so we have it and dont have to manually look each of them up? Aside from this, I used the AI owned by Elon Musk (Grok) to get an estimate on how much time this should take. Grok said it should take between 8-13 hours of human labor. The information it gave me is in the Moneymeta Time Frame document I'm attaching here. I dont know if the process it described will help but I hope it will. Also, do you use AI/would you be willing to use it? It can make things a lot faster. As far as the time frame goes, if it's possible and you dont feel overworked, three weeks would be ideal! As far as the budget goes, I think it's $150 (plus the $10 I promised you which you are getting no matter what, so you'd get $160 if you did this project). I'm assuming some of the links I sent wont work, I used AI to collect them. If we cant use all the links/sources I sent for $150, could we do links for stuff being sold by governments in US, Canada, UK, China, and India for $150?
	>
	> I also used Grok to get a general idea of things for the Boomerplus project. It said it should take about 2-6 hours of human labor for 200 movies/shows. We have more than this on our lists but a lot of our links dont work and I need to update them so I dont know how much we will have total. Our budget for this project (which includes creating working widgets; I'm including the links to codes I made so you could use them) is $180. If you can get working links for the ones that are broken (all the movie links are broken except for 12 of them which are already uploaded to our google bucket, and all of the radio show links are also broken from what I know and its definitely more, than we will pay you an extra $40. As far as getting the links, you would need to use AI to get working links or some type of way to get a lot at once, we wouldnt want you looking for things one by one. If you cannot find working links but copy and paste the links AI or whatever website you looked on gave you to show us that you tried, we will still pay the extra $40.
	>
	> I included a document that has the codes/visual design for the Boomerplus widgets. These codes just need to be put together. I made them using AI. Then you would just need to link them to whatever we are using for the content, get the description to go in the ABOUT section, and make a working comment section. If you want to do the Boomerplus project, read the document I sent you about it yesterday again, to make sure you remember the things we are asking for. I know I've sent you a lot of information and I'm sure you have other clients.

	> Hello Brianne,
	> Thanks for sharing all these details and being proactive — I really appreciate it.
	>
	> To complete both projects, I’ll need around one month in total.
	> According to your message, the budget for MoneyMeta is $150 and for BoomerPlus is $180, correct?
	>
	> I’ll start working on these projects in two days, and if I need any clarification, I’ll reach out to you.
	> Before starting, I’ll refine the requirements so that we have a clear document outlining exactly what we’re trying to accomplish.
	>
	> Are you okay with that?

- 6:00 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Yes that sounds perfect! My only fear with a one month time frame is that if you decide not to do the project we will have lost a month of time. Would you be able to provide us with something we could use every week? So if you decide not to do/complete the project we wont have a total loss?

- 6:14 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hello Brianne,
	> I understand your concern. In the worst case, it may take up to one month, as AdSense usually takes around 2–3 weeks to verify the account. I’ll share a Kanban board with you once I start working on the project. It will include “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Done,” and “Challenges” lists, where you can check the daily progress of the project. I believe that will address your concern.

- 7:30 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Okay! So I know for boomerplus we could see the files in the Google bucket as they are put in. Is there anyway you could provide us with something for Moneymeta as it is being complete?

- 7:50 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> I prefer to manage projects using GitHub Projects, and any custom code will be stored in a GitHub repository to track changes and documentation. This setup also allows us to roll back to a previous version if needed. Additionally, in Webflow, I will share a staging link with you so that you can visually check the current progress of the project.

- 8:11 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Okay we were hoping to use Google sites if possible unless the ads wont work on there. I've never used GitHub but will it store all the videos? Can you still upload the files to our google buckets and youtube? Can I create a Github account for you to use? We need to have full access to whatever we're using in case something happens to you we have to be able to get to our project. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience!!!!!!!! I'm sorry for all the questions!

- 8:20 PM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hello Brianne,
	> No worries at all — it’s completely okay. We need to be fully clear about the requirements.
	>
	> Yes, please go ahead and create a GitHub account. I will then add you as a collaborator on the project. Since the project is confidential, I will create a private repository, and GitHub account is necessary to collaborate.
	>
	> I also want to clarify a few points:
	> - Google Sites cannot be used, as it doesn’t offer enough flexibility or control for custom modifications.
	> - We will not use GitHub to store videos. For videos, we will continue using the platform you are currently using.
	> - GitHub will only be used for storing custom code, documents, and project tracking.
	>
	> Thank you for your patience, and feel free to ask any questions.

- 9:36 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Okay! So can Google sites be used for either project or should we use webflow for both? I will create the GitHub, get webflow site, and get on the other tasks you need me to do later today! 😄

	> Hi! What do you think about Framer? What plan would we need if we went with this?
	> https://www.framer.com/pricing
	> And what plan would we need if we did webflow?
	> https://webflow.com/pricing
	> Also, when someone clicks on a movie/show/commercial and the video player pops up, does that count as a page for each movie/show/commercial?

- 5:14 AM — Brianne Talocka
	> Also for the Moneymeta widgets, when someone clicks on an item, does that count as a page, it needs to be sharable so it must right?

- 10:44 AM — MD Mehedi Hasan Parvez
	> Hi Brianne,
	>
	> Thanks for your questions!
	> For the item cards and sharing functionality, it really depends on how much content we get from each auction listing. If the response are detailed then we can create dedicated pages for each item. But if the api reponse does not contain lots of data then we'll keep all items on the same page within the homepage widget. In that case, when someone clicks share, they'll get a deep link like moneymeta.app/#item-12345 that scrolls directly to that specific card.
	>
	> Now for the platform costs and options. If we go with Webflow, we'd need the CMS plan, which runs $23/month for the site plus $19/month for the workspace—so $42/month total.
	>
	> With Framer, we could start with the Basic plan at $15/month. That includes their CMS for one list and basic integrations. For comments, we'd need to use a third-party plugin like Disqus or CommentBox.io, or connect to a custom database.
	>
	> The third option—if you're comfortable with custom code then we can use Netlify with Next.js and Firestore along with your Google Cloud Storage Bucket. This approach is almost completely free to start depending on the traffic on the site.
	>
	> Let me know which options you are comfortable with.
	>
	> Home
	> moneymeta
	> CommentBox.io - No ads. No Tracking. Just Comments.
	> Hosted commenting that's painless to embed, a pleasure to use, and a breeze to moderate.

- 1:36 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Okay let’s go with Framer! And the third party plugin and the custom code sound good to me! Will the basic Framer plan with CMS for one list be sufficient? I definitely want the current sales/auctions and upcoming sales/auctions on separate pages. Should we do the next level up? Also do you know what we should use for Boomerplus?

	> Hello Brianne,
	> Thanks for sharing the information. I understand the situation now. You added the website for verification, but for the verification to be successful, you need to add the meta tag that AdSense provides in the header section. Unfortunately, we can’t do that on Google Sites.

	> The projects we are discussing are not very complex, so we can use just four milestones for them. I would appreciate it if you could close the current contract and start a new one. Also, if you feel that more items should be added to the milestones, please make the necessary changes. And if you think the number of milestones should be higher, please adjust that as well.
	> After you activate the milestones, please share the Framer account credentials with me. We can then start working on the project right away.
	>
	> Also, please share any website you would like the MoneyMeta project to resemble, if you have something in mind. Otherwise, I will create the initial design, and we can make changes according to your preferences.

	> Brianne Talocka approved the milestone — Milestone 1: "Developer needed for websites" (View details)

- 6:29 PM — Brianne Talocka
	> Hi! Here is the document! I will send you the framer account credentials now! I think I'm going to adjust these milestones if that's okay. How do I adjust them? I was thinking the milestone could be:
	>
	> 2. moneymeta delivery (what you listed for 2)
	>
	> 3. Movies, TV shows, their meta data and posters/images in the google buckets and on youtube. $30
	>
	> 4. Radio shows, concerts, commercials, their meta data, and their images/posters, as well as the images from the document I sent you, in the google buckets and uploaded to youtube $30

	> Sorry, I didn’t understand that. By the way, you can simply close this contract and create a new one with the updated milestones. Yes, please make the changes to the milestones, and I will review them and let you know if anything needs to be adjusted.

	> 4. boomerplus complete $120
	>
	> 5. adsense $30
